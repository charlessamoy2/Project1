Hi welcome to my project hehe

Some notable features:
1. all levels in 1 html file toggled by visibilities
2. all levels are reset when you go home
3. click level one "hello world" button multiple times and see what happens hehe
4. level two checks if field has been inputed before giving an output

Some parts of the code can still be refactored but yeah...
